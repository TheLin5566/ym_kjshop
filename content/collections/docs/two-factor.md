Two-step authentication (also known as two-factor authentication or multifactor authentication) provides a more secure login process. When you attempt to sign in, you need to complete two separate steps:

1. Enter the account password.
2. Authenticate through a mobile app security key.

These two steps will make much more difficult for an unauthorized person to access your account. Even if they are able to find your password, they will not be able to connect without the second step.

Authentication in two secure steps rests on the combination of two factors, which can be something you know (such as your combination of connection and password), something you have (such as a code to Only one use provided by an authentication application or SMS) or something you are (providing biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint).

Two-step authentication can be configured for all accounts, but the store owner can not activate it for staff. The staff must put it in place for his own accounts. If you have multiple employees who manage your shop.

## Enabling two-factor authentication

To enable two-step authentication, you'll need first to download an authenticator app to your mobile device. The app will be able to scan QR codes and retrieve authentication data for you. Recommended authenticator apps:

- [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)
- [Duo Mobile](https://guide.duo.com/third-party-accounts)
- [Amazon AWS MFA](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa)
- [Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/microsoft-authenticator/9nblgggzmcj6)

In addition, you should store the listed recovery codes in a secure password manager such as [1Password](https://1password.com).

When you install an authenticator app, make sure that you follow its instructions carefully. After your app is successfully downloaded and set up, you can activate the feature in Shopper.
