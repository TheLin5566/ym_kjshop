When you have installed Shopper you create and setup a shop that will serve you as the first location.

You can update your store information when needed, edit your store images, update the complete address, the legal name of your shop.

Laravel Shopper at the moment doesn't manage several currencies so you must select with what currency you will sell on your site.

To edit your shop information, you must:

- From your administration Click on **Settings**
- Click on **General** and update your information
- Click on **Update Information**
